# LCMStools

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

This package includes functions that I use frequently in my LC/MS or HPLC data flow.

## Installation

You can install the development version of LCMStools like so:

``` r
devtools::install_github('jmorim/LCMStools')
```

## Example

ConvertDtoMZML converts an Agilent MS1 data file (MS2 coming soon) to mzML.
mzML files can be read by packages like MetaboAnalyst and xcms.

```{r example}
library(LCMStools)

ConvertDtoMZML(path='data', path.out='data/_mzML')
```
